v1.1

 - Added a group system
 - Renamed "updating" of items to "releasing" for consistency
 - Renamed "removing" of items to "deleting" for consistency
 - Removing items now happens in a seperate function for easier access from other parts of the code
 - Items can now be unreleased via command /ui unrelease <item>
 - Realized that renaming items is not possible realistically because the name of the item is saved on all instances of the item. Maybe this will somehow become a feature in the future, but probably not
 - Added an option to auto-refresh the items for all online players after releasing an item
 - Added saving enchantments
 - Added saving custom model data
 - Added saving atttributes
